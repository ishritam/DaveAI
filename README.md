# Dave.AI 

## Key Features 
This project is based on Python. It can be used as a sample backend for customer data processing.


## The key features are:
1) Given 2 CSV, it'll merge the data from both the files.
2) If a customer exists in both the CSVs, it'll consider two.csv is the latest available data and one.csv is the older data set.  
3) Sort the data based on the first name.
4) Finaly, will create a JSON file of JSON Objects of sorted data

  - It is advised to create a virtual enviornment if you have existing conflicts with python & other libraries/packages installtions.

## Quickstart
  - Install all necessary dependencies for this project from requirements.txt
    - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing dependencies. 
  - Please change parameters accordingly in (config.py) config file. (File_1 as `one.csv` and File_2 as `two.csv`)
  - Run app.py file in for turn on the API.
    - Run `python main.py`
